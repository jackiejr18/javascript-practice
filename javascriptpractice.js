// Increment / Decrement operators 

/* The increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1*/ 

// the increment operator is ++
// the decrement operator is -- 

// can be used prefix and postfix

let a = 10;

console.log(a--); 
console.log(a);

/* in this example operator is placed after the variable, and the value of the variable is logged before it
is decremented */
