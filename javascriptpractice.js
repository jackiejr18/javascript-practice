//Objects in javaScript

// Javascript object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple collections of data.
// "key: value" pairs are called properties, key is always stored as string
// when we declare a function as a value in key:value pair then it is known as Methods

const person = new Object(); 

person.firstName = 'Elon';
person.lastName = 'Musk';
person.age = 35; 

console.log(person);
